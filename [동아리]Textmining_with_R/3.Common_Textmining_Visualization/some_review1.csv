141,"This is a must visit for any person touring downtown Los Angeles. And best time - weekday after 8:30 pm to avoid the rush. And whoever came up with the interior deco of giving the place a cowboy look, a sandwich on me!"
142,Well aged interior with wooden tables and stools. Great French Dip sandwiches and sides. You come for the food and the nostalgia of good old days. It may not be serving the world's greatest sandwiches but it does the job well and will not disappoint.
143,"If you are looking for a truly original Los Angeles experience, look no further than Philippe's for the inventor of the Beef Dip Sandwich. Get a taste of old L.A. and the best tasting beef dip around."
