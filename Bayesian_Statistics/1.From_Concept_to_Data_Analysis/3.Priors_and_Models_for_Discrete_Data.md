# 3. Prior and Models for Discrete Data

## (1) Priors
We have seen that we can use prior belief when calculating the posterior probability in Bayesian Inference. So, how do we choose a prior?
A useful concept in terms of choosing priors is that of calibration.

Let's take an example. (ref : https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics )</br>
Suppose you are tasked with eliciting a prior distribution for θ, the proportion of taxpayers who file their returns after the deadline. After speaking with several tax experts, but before collecting data, you are reasonably confident that \thetaθ is greater than 0.05, but less than 0.20.

The prior distribution above most accurately reflects theses prior beliefs about θ. This prior assigns approximately 95% of the prior probability to the interval (0.05, 0.20). It is a strongly informative prior, but it is consistent with our prior beliefs.
