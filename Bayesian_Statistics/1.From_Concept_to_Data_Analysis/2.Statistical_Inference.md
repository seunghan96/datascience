# 2. Statistical Inference

## (1) Frequentists Inference
### a) Confidence Interval
Frequentists view data as a random sample from a large population, and make a probability statements based on those populations.
What does the confidence interval of frequentists imply?

Let's take an example. </br>
One people filpped a coin 100 times, and got 44 heads and 56 tails. This test
follows a Bernoulli distribution with probability p. 
Let's say p is the case of the coin getting the heads.
</br>

So, what is his 'estimate of p' (=phat) and the Convidence Interval (=CI)?
From the Frequentists view, they will say that their estimate of p is '0.44' (=44/100).
And the confidence interval 95% can be calculated as </br>
( 44-1.96*sqrt(100*0.44*0.56), 44+1.96*sqrt(100*0.44*0.56) ) </br>
and this will become ( 0.343, 0.537 ).
</br>
</br>
Since 0.5(half, which represents a 'fair' coin) is inside this interval, which makes them say
that this coin is a fair coin.
</br>
So what is the meaning of the '95% confident'?
According to the frequentists' view, it means that if they repeat this many times, and average of
95% of the intervals will contain the true value of p. 
</br>

But, it has a problem. We can not know something about
this particular interval that we get each time. They can not answer, "What's the probability of
this interval contaning the true p?" They only consider whether the p is in that interval or not, so they can only answer by '0' or '1'.
</br>

### b. Likelihood function and Maximum Likelihood
I will not cover too much with this mle, assuming that you already learned. </br>
In short, mle (maximum likelihood estimator) is a method of estimating the parameters of probability distribution 
by maximizing a likelihood function, so that the observed data is most probable to have come from that distribution.
