# 1. Probability and Bayes' Theorem

## (1) Probability
### a) Classical and Frequentist Probability

Statistics : 'study of uncertainty'
</br>
There are 3 different frameworks, under which we define "probability"
- Classical Framework
- Freqeuntist Framework
- Bayesian Framework

#### Classical Framework
outcomes that are equally likely have equal probabilities </br>
( ex. fair die with number 1~6 -> so the prob of each outcome is one sixth )

#### Frequentist Framework
- find P(data|model) ( = assuming the data with the model that we have )
- model : certian / data : uncertain
- "objective" in how it defines probability
- "relative" frequency
- outcome : point estimates with standard error
- parameter of the model : fixed & unkown constant

#### Bayesian Framework
- find P(model|data) ( = assuming the model with the data that we have )
- model : uncertain / data : ground truth
- "subjective" in how it defines probability
- degree of belief
- outcome : posterior distribution
- parameter of the model : random variables
</br>

These are the brief summary of three frameworks with probability, and I'm going to focus on the "Bayesian Framework".

### b. Bayesian Probability and Coherence
Bayesian perspective is 'personal' perspective. A subjective approach to probability can lead to a more intuitive result in many cases, 
compared to Frequentists.
</br>
</br>
Let's take an example. </br>
You made a bet that you win 10$ if it rains tomorrow, and lose 1$ if it doesn't. </br>
What is the a probability(=p) that it will rain tomorrow, from your own belief? 
</br>
(10 * p) + ((-1)*(1-p)) = 0 
</br>
Therefore, p is 1/9. And this result will depend on who the better will be. </br>
(of course, as long as you are not willing to lose money in this bet)
</br>
</br>
But don't forget. Coherence! Probability should follow all the rules of probability, or else you'll
lose money on that kind of bet!
