positive,"I absolutely liked it. Superheroes especially Marvel I can only take in smaller doses, but when we get all those superheros in this film it is so Epic"
positive," Infinity War certainly lives up too its hype, it is so fresh and enjoyable, they didn't look stupid like all stand around jacking each other off in those other superhero movies where they all do a line dance, singing like a bad music video. "
negative,"I really loved the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, and one of the reasons was the comedy and the music, but over here the jokes were not funny. It looked like they were trying too much. The characters a bit boring, it would've been better if they were not part of this movie."
positive,"Thank you for this addition. It was amazing, and a favorite."
negative," It's just another one of those flashy 21st century marvel movies, but longer and with more emotional moments I guess. And more characters, which makes it quite messy to me. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of this genre."

negative,"I hated how it was all over the place, most everyone died, the hulk never transformed."
negative,"Not in its entirety this movie is bad, the truth that the end is the bad part, in my opinion is more similar to a series, with the difference that we have to wait up to 2 years for the next chapter."
positive,This movie begins to pit our heroes against a great menace .It delivers on the action and funny jokes to juxtapose against the great tradegy

negative,But this was a muddled too fast paced big ball of a mess. Just killing of characters small jokes and love interest interactions does not save it in the least.
negative,The characters that died off like it was nothing deserved a better or more significant death. All in all this was beyond chaotic and terrible.
positive,Just see and enjoy this movie.
